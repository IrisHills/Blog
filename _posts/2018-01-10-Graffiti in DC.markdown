I am from Philly, where cool graffiti and street art is everywhere. When I went to college in DC I was shocked because there was little to no graffiti art, at least compared to Philly. There are some really nice murals, but they don't have much real graffiti. Thinking about it now, I should have expected it. DC is the nation's capital flooded with a sea of diplomats, suits, and politics. It’s a shame though because the art of graffiti is extraordinary. I missed the graffiti I was so used to seeing in Philly, so I looked up some spots to find it in DC. In my search, I found a blogger named Jonny Grave who he wrote about places to find graffiti in DC, one of which being Garfield Park. When I went I saw a quaint little children's park. Little kids were screaming and laughing as they played on the playground equipment and just below was the skatepark filled with amazing graffiti. I had to do a double take because it was so unexpected. The saturated hues of color against the dirty grey wall made the art almost 3-D.  All the graffiti was so organic and everything was different from each other yet blended together seamlessly. It was almost like going to an art installation at the Hershorn. Below is a combination of my photos and Johnny Grave’s photos from the skatepark.
