Sometimes I find that unfinished pairings are more interesting than perfectly polished works. Unfinished art allows the viewer to see the process of the artist and look at the bones of a painting. I love artists that show their unfinished work and reveal their process with people. This is why I enjoy  Sheena Randerwalaâ€™s Instagram so much. Not only does she post finished works but she shows her followers her process.
