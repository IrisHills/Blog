tittle: "About Me" 
---
My name is Iris Hills and I am a graphic design student at American University. I always love finding new artists and artwork to share with the community. This blog features all mediums of visual art including anything from web design to painting. I will discuss and show the intersection of design, technology, and society and the impact art has on the world. Below are links to art I have done or that I find especially interesting or visually pleasing. Hope you enjoy!
