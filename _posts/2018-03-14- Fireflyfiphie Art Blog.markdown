I love Fiphieâ€™s blog, Fireflyfiphie. She combines her thought-provoking poetry with intricate line work drawings. 
Her art is unique because it incorporates nature and drawing, producing an almost scrapbook effect. 
Her art poses an authentic vulnerability that says something about humanity. 
I think what impresses me the most is her ability to convey emotion with her work.
