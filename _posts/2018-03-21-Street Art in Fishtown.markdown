One of my favorite places in Philly is Fishtown. It has the best coffee, thrift stores and most of all street art. It is the type of place that has artistic energy flowing in the air. Colorful murals decorate every street and there is a quaint little shop at every corner. As I was walking, I began to notice that there were really cool stickers with famous quotes all over the neighborhood. Trying to find all the stickers was like a fun little scavenger hunt. below are all the ones I found in my travels, but I am sure there are many more out there. <br>
<br>
“Art washes away from the soul, the dust of everyday life.”- Pablo Picasso <br>
<br>
“Nothing is worth more than laughter. It is strength to laugh and to abandon oneself, to be light. Tragedy is the most ridiculous thing.”-Frida Kahlo <br>
<br>
“You are a divine being. You matter, you count. You come from realms of unimaginable power and light, and you will return to those realms” -Terence McKenna <br>
<br>
“Most of us try to avoid the sense that death can come at any time, but its timing is unknown to us. Can we live each day as if it were our last? Can we relate to one another as if there were no tomorrow?”- Roshi Joan Halifax <br>
<br>
“HATE, It has caused a lot of problem in the world. But has not solved one yet.”-Maya Angelou <br>
