Not only is this a useful website for all designers because it has a bunch of graphic design conferences and workshops, but I also appreciate the website design. The website obviously had a big budget and it paid off. It is incredibly organized and especially aesthetically pleasing. This website has a lot of great information, but I would honestly visit the website just to look at the art on the site.
