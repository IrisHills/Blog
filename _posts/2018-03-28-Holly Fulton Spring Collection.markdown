I love when two mediums mix together to make something new and the Holly Fulton Spring 2013 Fashion Collection is a perfect example of that. This collection is a combination of painting and fashion which I love. The use of clear vinyl is really interesting and adds a cool structural feel while still achieving a soft vibe with the hand painted flowers. Maya Singers use of textiles is really unique and brings something new to the fashion world.
