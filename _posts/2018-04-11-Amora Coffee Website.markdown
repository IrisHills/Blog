I don't know about you, but I love coffee. I love how it smells, how it tastes, I could go on and on but that is not the point of this post. I am posting about this not because of its subject matter, but the website design. I love the aesthetics and high def images of this website. It is not only pretty but also very and well designed. It advertises the product in a way that makes you want to drink a nice hot cup of joe.
