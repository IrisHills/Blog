What I love about Ana Santosâ€™ work is the effervescent ethereal quality she infuses into her work. She plays with lots of colors and textures to create bright corky works of art. She manages to combine fantasy and realism together without going down the mermaid or fairy realm. Ana seems to have a special relationship with humans facial features and nature, and that shows in her work.
