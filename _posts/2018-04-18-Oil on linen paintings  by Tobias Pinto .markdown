Tobias Pintoâ€™s paintings have a strong sense of physiological intensity that is captivating. Something about his work makes me never want to look away. His paintings almost have a photograph quality because of his amazing shading. Not only are his paintings incredibly realistic, but they also convey a deeply emotional depth.
