I can confidently say that math and science is not my favorite subject, but I always have loved art class. I would never think that the two subjects could intertwine because to me they are like fire and ice. Apparently, Elia Pellegrini thought otherwise. Her work incorporates elaborate and colorful drawing overtop science and math sketches. I can't say that her work makes me like math or science, but I will admit that it very visually pleasing and impressive.
