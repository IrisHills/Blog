My favorite qualities of paint are its vibrant colors and the interesting textures it provides. Ingrid Chingâ€™s work showcases all the thing I love about pain. Her work is simple in subject matter but complex in color and texture. I would love to use her painting for textiles, I would die for a dress that looked like her cool paintings.
