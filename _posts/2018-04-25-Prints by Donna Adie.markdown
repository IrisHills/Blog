A lot of artists (myself included) get inspiration from pop-culture. This type of art often resonates with viewers because it connects art to what is actually happening in their lives. Donna Adi uses pop icon photos and illustrates over them transforming them into illustration art pieces. Her somewhat provocative work mixes illustration and photography to give the viewer a multidimensional experience that I personally am obsessed with.
