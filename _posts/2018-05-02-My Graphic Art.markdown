Before going to college I told myself I would never draw on the computer. Little did I know that I would love it. I made my first vector image a few months ago and I have never stopped since. I thought I would hate it because I thought the electronic screen would take away from what I love about creating art. I now know that I love creating images on an electronic screen. It is definitely different than painting, but I like it just as much. I hope as I keep learning in school, I'll get better at it.
