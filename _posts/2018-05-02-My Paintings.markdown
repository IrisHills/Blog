Recently I haven't done that much painting because of school, but it's something  I always love doing. 
Painting is therapeutic for me. I love mixing paint and combining unusual colors. 
I would never be a professional painter, but sometimes it nice to get away from the screen and just use paint on a canvas.
Below are some of my paintings, they aren't perfect by any means, but I had fun making them.
